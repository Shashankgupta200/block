The above preview shows how the website will look finally.
The middle red block is the main player which you can move with 'a' and 'd'.
If you click 'space' then the block will be back at its original position if not in desired position.
Once the red block collides with the blue block the game will end and GAME OVER will be shown in the top left corner
